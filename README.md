# Twitter Anti-Bullying Bot
This project aims to develop a Twitter bot that detects and flags hate speech, ideally in both English and Korean. For example, using YouTube API, this bot will strive to automatically detect and flag hate speech, and also respond to Twitter users who tag this bot (e.g. @antibullyingbot). More details will be updated soon.
